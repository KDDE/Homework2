To run this code, run:
`$python IKDDhw2.py`

The output is presented with a table. For the best result, use a terminal
with 80 columns or higher, and use monospace fonts. Some ambiguous width
character might cause the align problem in the table.

Note: This program is written in python 2 and requires `psycopg2` package.

The source code of psycopg2 is included in this repository.
